# Principles of operation

The DNP3 adapter's operations focus on data collection and stream creation.

## Connectivity and interoperability

The DNP3 adapter can connect to one or more DNP3 compliant outstations through TCP/IP connections. The DNP3 adapter will not communicate with other DNP3 master stations. The total number of outstations that the adapter can connect to varies across different installation environments.  

The DNP3 adapter is designed to operate as a Level 1 (DNP3–L1) master station. DNP3-L1 defines minimum requirements for all DNP3 compliant devices. However, the adapter makes use of some Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 functions. Some DNP3 compliant devices can not support these same features. Any functionality described in this documentation that is not required for Level 1 compliance is noted as such. Refer to the outstation documentation prior to using these features, as the adapter needs to be configured to only use the supported features of the outstation.  

## Adapter configuration

For the DNP3 adapter to start data collection, you need to configure the adapter by defining the following:

- Data source: Provide the information required to connect to your DNP3 compliant outstations.
- Data selection: Select the DNP points on the outstations you want the adapter to collect for data.
- Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior.

For more information, see [PI Adapter for DNP3 data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterForDNP3DataSourceConfiguration), [PI Adapter for DNP3 data selection configuration](xref:PIAdapterForDNP3DataSelectionConfiguration), and [Logging configuration](xref:LoggingConfiguration).

## Stream creation

The DNP3 adapter creates types at startup. One stream is created for each selected DNP point represented by an item in the data selection configuration. Each stream contains three properties:

| Property name | Data type | Description
| ------------- | --------- | -----------
| `Timestamp` | DateTime | Timestamp of the value update for the DNP point
| `Value` | Specified in the data selection configuration | Value of the DNP point
| `Quality` | Byte | Data quality of the given DNP3 item update. Quality values are `Good` and `Bad`.<br><br>**Note:** The indicator for bad data quality changes based on the data selection item's data type. |

**Note:** All streams contain the `Quality` property except if the data type is `string`.

Certain metadata are sent with each stream created. The following metadata are common for every adapter type:

- **ComponentID**: Specifies the data source, for example, _DNP3_1_
- **ComponentType**: Specifies the type of adapter, for example, _DNP3_

The following metadata is specific to DNP3:

- **Outstation**: Specifies the Id of the outstation that the stream data is collected from. For example, _Outstation1_
- **SourceId**: Specifies the information used to uniquely identify the stream on the source system. For DNP3, this is the outstation Id, the DNP Point Type, and the index. For example, _Outstation1.AnalogInput.3_
- **Schedule**: Specifies the schedule used to collect data for the stream. For DNP3, this correlates to the StaticScanScheduleId property of the selection item. For example, _schedule1_

Each stream created for a given DNP point has a unique identifier (stream ID). If you specify a custom stream ID for the DNP point in data selection configuration, the adapter uses that stream ID to create the stream.
If the stream ID is not specified, the adapter uses the `DefaultStreamIdPattern` in the data source configuration to determine the stream ID.

### Discovery

The DNP3 adapter can discover points on your DNP3 outstation by performing an integrity scan. For more information, see [Integrity scans](#integrity-scans).
Discovery populates your data selection configuration with items that represent points on the outstation. These items are unselected by default, so you can make changes to these items before you select them. The adapter can only discover points that are assigned to Class 0, Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 on the outstation. Discovery can be demanding in terms of bandwidth and outstation resources, so the adapter only performs discovery for an outstation when the following criteria are met:

- The outstation is configured in the data source configuration.
- The adapter is configured to perform a startup integrity scan for that outstation.
- The data selection configuration contains no items that correlate to that outstation, either selected or unselected.

To discover a new outstation, add the outstation to the data source configuration and configure a periodic integrity scan or a scan on startup. The adapter uses the startup integrity scan as a means for discovery. To configure a new outstation without triggering a discovery, you can add one or more selection items to correspond to the outstation. The items can be selected or unselected. Alternatively, you can configure the outstation behavior so that no startup integrity scan is performed. Without a startup integrity scan, discovery is not be possible.

## Data collection

The DNP3 adapter can collect two different types of data from DNP3 compliant outstations: static data and event data.

### Static data

The DNP3 specification defines static data as the current value of a DNP point at the time of a request. The DNP3 adapter can be configured to request static data by polling the outstation for a range of points that share an object group and variation, which are configured in the data selection configuration. Static data is reported with the current time of the adapter machine. When polling for static data at predefined rate, it is possible that quickly changing data can be missed by the adapter. It is also possible that the adapter receives multiple values representing the same event but with different timestamps.

The adapter makes a request for the current value of specific points as configured in the data selection configuration file. The adapter requests this data through a range scan, which request the static data for a range of point indices that share a group and variation, as configured in the data selection configuration.
The outstation should report the current value of each point, but the outstation is not required to report using the requested object variation. If the outstation responds with a different variation than what the adapter has requested, the adapter still sends the data it receives. This could lead to differences in the reported value versus what is expected in terms of precision and status.

Support for requesting static data for DNP3 points through a range scan is at least a Level 2 functionality, and some groups and variations can be considered Level 3 or Level 4 functionality. Because of this, it is important to verify that your outstation supports this functionality before configuring the adapter to collect data in this manner. Some DNP3-L1 compliant outstations can optionally support this type of scan.

### Event data

The DNP3 specification defines event data as the information that is retained regarding an event. An event is defined by the DNP3 specification as the occurrence of something significant happening. What constitutes an event can vary depending on the implementation of the outstation. Typically, an event results in a value change for a DNP point, although it is possible for an event to occur that does not change the value of any point on the outstation. Event data is saved at the outstations and should be kept until the adapter confirms that it has received the event object. The event object is the description of the event that the adapter should receive from the outstations. The event object can contain the value, time, and status code relating to the event and corresponding point. The exact information contained in the object is dependent on both the point type and variation defined in the DNP3 specification.  

DNP3 events belong to one of three different classes of data: Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3. These event classes can be used to group events by priority, though neither the DNP3 adapter nor the DNP3 specification assign significance to the three event classes. According to the DNP3 specification, all DNP3 – Level 1 compliant outstations accepts read requests for event class data.  

#### Event scans

The DNP3 adapter can be configured to request event data through an event scan. During an event scan, the adapter polls the outstation(s) for the event data from each of the configured event classes. The event classes and the polling interval can be configured in the data source configuration. For more information, see [PI Adapter for DNP3 data source configuration](xref:PIAdapterForDNP3DataSourceConfiguration#outstationbehavior-parameters).

Event scans offer several advantages over polling for static data. When polling for static data, it is possible to miss value changes for points on the outstation; however, event scans ensures that each outstation reports every event to the adapter. Similarly, even when polling quickly, some events could be missed if they do not change the value of the DNP point. If bandwidth is a concern, the adapter can make efficient use of the network by only requesting event data. When polling for static data, the outstation can report unchanging data unnecessarily, whereas event scans should only return new events. It is important that the adapter is configured to perform event scans at an interval that is not long enough to allow the outstation event buffers to become full. To determine what constitutes an event and how much time it takes before the buffer becomes full, refer to the documentation for a specific outstation.

#### Unsolicited events

In addition to the event scans above, the DNP3 adapter can be configured to receive unsolicited responses containing event data. An unsolicited response is a message sent from an outstation that the adapter did not explicitly request. If the adapter is configured to receive unsolicited data, outstations that support sending unsolicited data should report event data to the adapter as it occurs. This could eliminate the need for the adapter to poll the outstation(s) for data. The decision to configure the adapter to receive unsolicited data or to perform event scans should be carefully considered.  

### Integrity scans

The DNP3 adapter can be configured to perform an integrity scan on startup, when the outstation's event buffer overflows, at a defined interval, or any combination of the three. During an integrity scan, the adapter polls the outstations for events and then the current value of all points that are assigned to one of the event classes (or Class 0).
The adapter performs an integrity scan by polling `Object Group 60`. If bandwidth or outstation performance is a concern, carefully consider the value of an integrity scan, as the outstation can respond with data for many more points than the adapter is configured to collect data for. The adapter simply discards any data that it receives without a corresponding data selection item. To retrieve the current value of any points not assigned to an event class, the adapter needs to perform a static scan.

If a startup integrity scan is configured, it will run whenever the adapter is started or whenever a shutdown is indicated by the outstation's IIN bits. It may also be used for discovery. Alternatively, if no startup integrity scan is configured, but an integrity scan at a set interval is defined, then the first integrity scan will still be performed when the adapter is started. In this scenario, the first integrity scan will not be used for discovery, because a startup integrity scan was not configured.
