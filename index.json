DNP3 data source schema The full schema definition for the DNP3 data source configuration is in the DNP3_DataSource_schema.json file located in one of the following folders: Windows: %ProgramFiles%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\DNP3\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/DNP3/Schemas DNP3 data source parameters Many of the data source configuration parameters are split into four categories: Parameters that define the adapter's behavior as a DNP3 master station are defined as MasterStationBehaviors . Parameters that define the general behaviors of the DNP3 outstations are defined as OutstationBehaviors . Parameters that define the connection information for a TCP channel are defined as TCPChannels . Parameters that define the connection information for a specific outstation are defined as Outstations . The following parameters are available to configure a DNP3 data source: Parameter Required Type Description MasterStationBehaviors Required array List of MasterStationBehavior objects that specifies the adapter's behavior as a DNP3 master station. For additional information, see MasterStationBehavior Parameters . OutstationBehaviors Required array List of OutstationBehavior objects that specifies general behaviors for DNP3 outstations. For additional information, see OutstationBehavior Parameters . TCPChannels Required array List of TCPChannel objects that specifies TCP connection information. For additional information, see TCPChannel Parameters . StreamIdPrefix Optional string Specifies what prefix is used for stream IDs. Specifying null or omitting this parameter results in the ComponentID followed by a dot character being used to prefix the stream IDs. Note: An empty string means no prefix is added to the stream IDs. DefaultStreamIdPattern Optional string Specifies the default stream ID pattern to use. Possible parameters: {OutstationId} , {DNPPointType} , {Index} , {Group} , and {Variation} . An empty or null value results in {OutstationId}.{DNPPointType}.{Index} . MasterStationBehavior parameters The following parameters are available to configure each MasterStationBehavior in the MasterStationBehaviors array: Parameter Required Type Description Id Required string Friendly identifier for the configuration. Must be unique among all MasterStationBehaviors . MasterAddress Required number Address that the adapter uses when communicating on a channel. Must be an available address on the channel. Outstations can be configured to accept connections from this address. This is a 2 byte, unsigned integer. DataLinkLayerTimeout Optional string Period long enough for a Data Link Layer frame to be transmitted represented in hhh:mm:ss.fff format. Default value: 00:00:03 for 3 seconds DataLinkLayerRetries Optional number Number of times that the adapter re-sends a data link frame before resetting the link. Default value: 2 OutstationBehavior parameters The following parameters are available to configure each OutstationBehavior in the OutstationBehaviors array: Parameter Required Type Description Id Required string Friendly identifier for the configuration. Must be unique among all OutstationBehaviors . ApplicationLayerTimeout Optional string Period long enough for an entire Application Layer message to be transmitted represented in hh:mm:ss.fff format. Default value: 00:00:03 for 3 seconds EnableUnsolicited Optional boolean If true, the adapter accepts unsolicited messages from an outstation that is configured to send unsolicited event data. Allowed value: true or false Default value: true EnableTimeSync Optional boolean If true, the adapter writes the current time to an outstation that indicates \"NeedTime\" through the internal indication bits. Allowed value: true or false Default value: true IntegrityScanOnStartup Optional boolean If true, the adapter performs an integrity scan whenever the adapter or outstation is restarted. Allowed value: true or false Default value: true IntegrityScanOnEventBufferOverflow Optional boolean If true, the adapter performs an integrity scan whenever the outstation's event buffers overflow. Allowed value: true or false Default value: true IntegrityScanPeriod Optional string Frequency of integrity scans. Set to 00:00:00 for no periodic integrity scans represented in hh:mm:ss.fff format. Default value: 01:00:00 for 1 hour EventClasses Optional array List of event classes that the adapter scans during an event scan. Default is [1, 2, 3] , meaning all event classes. EventScanPeriod Optional string Frequency of event scans represented in hh:mm:ss.fff format. Set to 00:00:00 for no event scans. Default value: 00:00:00 TCPChannel parameters The following parameters are available to configure each channel in the TCPChannels array: Parameter Required Type Description HostNameOrIpAddress Required string IPv4 address or hostname that can be resolved to an IPv4 address. The adapter establishes a connection to this address. Port Optional number TCP port that the outstations are listening on. Default value: 20000 MasterStationBehaviorId Required string Must match the Id of one of the configurations in the MasterStationBehaviors list. Outstations Required array List of outstations that the adapter connects to on the TCPChannel . Note: A TCPChannel is uniquely identified by the combination of its HostNameOrIPAddress and Port properties. For valid configuration, each TCPChannel must have a unique combination of these properties. Outstation parameters The following parameters are available to configure each Outstation in the Outstations array within a TCPChannel : Parameter Required Type Description Id Required string Friendly identifier of the outstation. Must be unique among all channels and Outstations . Can be referenced by a data selection item. DNPAddress Required number Address of the Outstation on the channel. This is a 2 byte, unsigned integer. OutstationBehaviorId Required string Must match the Id of one of the configurations in the OutstationBehaviors array. DNP3 data source examples Minimum configuration for a single outstation The following example is a configuration for a single outstation on a single TCP channel. The optional configuration parameters have been omitted, so the default values are used. With the default configuration, the DNP3 adapter accepts unsolicited responses and perform an integrity scan every hour, potentially triggering Discovery . For more information about the default configuration, reference the tables above. { \"masterStationBehaviors\": [ { \"id\": \"masterBehavior1\", \"masterAddress\": 1 } ], \"outstationBehaviors\": [ { \"id\": \"outstationBehavior1\" } ], \"tcpChannels\": [ { \"masterStationBehaviorId\": \"masterBehavior1\", \"hostNameOrIpAddress\": \"outstation1.scadanetwork.int\", \"outstations\": [ { \"id\": \"Outstation1\", \"dnpAddress\": 10, \"outstationBehaviorId\": \"outstationBehavior1\" } ] } ] } Example configuration for multiple outstations The following example is a configuration for two outstations that are on one channel and one outstation that is on a separate channel. Rather than using the default configurations, many configuration options are expressed here. There are two MasterStationBehaviors , one of which increases the data link layer timeout and retry count. This can be needed when operating with network conditions that are less than ideal. Any TCPChannel that references the master station behavior poorNetworkConditions uses these settings, while TCPChannels that reference defaultMasterBehavior uses the default settings. There are three OutstationBehaviors : eventScans-integrityScan-noUnsolicited , busyOutstation , and class1Events : The behavior eventScans-integrityScan-noUnsolicited deviates from the default configuration options by disabling unsolicited responses and scanning for events every 10 minutes. This type of configuration is useful if the outstation does not support unsolicited events or it may be more efficient to scan for events periodically. The behavior busyOutstation deviates from the default configuration by increasing the application layer timeout, disabling the time sync, and disabling all integrity scans. Note: Disabling the integrity scan prevents discovery. Event scans are disabled by default. With this configuration, the DNP3 adapter only collects data if it is configured to collect static data . This type of configuration is useful if the outstation is very busy. For instance, the adapter can not be the only master communicating with this outstation, so another master station is responsible for syncing the outstation's time and polling for events. In addition, an integrity scan can put too much burden on the outstation if there are a large number of points. The behavior class1Events deviates from the default configuration by disabling unsolicited responses, only performing an integrity scan on startup, and only scanning for events from points assigned to class 1. This configuration is useful if you are not interested in collecting data for points assigned to class 2 or class 3. There are two TCPChannels configured. One channel has two outstations configured. This channel might represent a connection to a DNP3 gateway at a substation. The other TCPChannel only contains one configured outstation. This might represent a DNP3 device that is in a remote location. { \"masterStationBehaviors\": [ { \"id\": \"poorNetworkConditions\", \"masterAddress\": 1, \"dataLinkLayerTimeout\": \"00:00:05\", \"dataLinkLayerRetries\": 5 }, { \"id\": \"defaultMasterBehavior\", \"masterAddress\": 1 } ], \"outstationBehaviors\": [ { \"id\": \"eventScans-integrityScan-noUnsolicited\", \"enableUnsolicited\": false, \"EventClasses\": [ 1, 2, 3 ], \"eventScanPeriod\": \"00:10:00\" }, { \"id\": \"busyOutstation\", \"applicationLayerTimeout\": \"00:00:30\", \"enableTimeSync\": false, \"integrityScanOnStartup\": false, \"integrityScanOnEventBufferOverflow\": false, \"integrityScanPeriod\": \"00:00:00\" }, { \"id\": \"class1Events\", \"applicationLayerTimeout\": \"00:00:03\", \"enableUnsolicited\": false, \"integrityScanOnStartup\": true, \"integrityScanOnEventBufferOverflow\": false, \"integrityScanPeriod\": \"00:00:00\", \"EventClasses\": [ 1 ], \"eventScanPeriod\": \"00:10:00\" } ], \"tcpChannels\": [ { \"masterStationBehaviorId\": \"defaultMasterBehavior\", \"hostNameOrIpAddress\": \"substation1.scadanetwork.int\", \"outstations\": [ { \"id\": \"outstation10\", \"dnpAddress\": 10, \"outstationBehaviorId\": \"eventScans-integrityScan-noUnsolicited\" }, { \"id\": \"outstation100\", \"dnpAddress\": 100, \"outstationBehaviorId\": \"busyOutstation\" } ] }, { \"masterStationBehaviorId\": \"poorNetworkConditions\", \"hostNameOrIpAddress\": \"outstation11.scadanetwork.int\", \"port\": 20001, \"outstations\": [ { \"id\": \"Outstation11\", \"dnpAddress\": 11, \"outstationBehaviorId\": \"class1Events\" } ] } ] }"

    "keywords": "PI Adapter for DNP3 overview PI Adapter for DNP3 is a data-collection component that transfers time-series data from source devices to OMF (OSIsoft Message Format) endpoints in OSIsoft Cloud Services or PI Servers. DNP3 is a communication protocol common in SCADA networks. The protocol is maintained by the DNP Users Group, and defined by IEEE Std 1815-2012. The adapter adheres to this standard and operates as a DNP3-L1 compliant master station, which communicates with compliant outstations through TCP/IP. Adapter installation You can install the adapter with a download kit that you can obtain from the OSIsoft Customer Portal. You can install the adapter on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. Adapter configuration Using the REST API, you can configure all functions of the adapter. The configurations are stored in JSON files. For data ingress, you must define an adapter component in the system components configuration for each device to which the adapter will connect. You configure each adapter component with the connection information for the device and the data to collect. For data egress, you must specify destinations for the data, including security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add buffering configuration to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting purposes. Once you have configured the adapter and it is sending data, you can use administration functions to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Health and diagnostics functions monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. EdgeCmd utility OSIsoft also provides the EdgeCmd utility, a proprietary command line tool to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. EdgeCmd utility is installed separately from the adapter."

    "keywords": "Install PI Adapter for DNP3 using Docker Docker is a set of tools that can be used on Linux to manage application deployments. This topic provides examples of how to create a Docker container with the DNP3 adapter. Note: If you want to use Docker, you must be familiar with the underlying technology and have determined that it is appropriate for your planned use of the DNP3 adapter. Docker is not a requirement to use the adapter. Create a startup script for the adapter Use a text editor and create a script similar to one of the following examples: Note: The script varies slightly by processor. ARM32 #!/bin/sh if [ -z $portnum ] ; then exec /DNP3_linux-arm/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host else exec /DNP3_linux-arm/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host --port:$portnum fi ARM64 #!/bin/sh if [ -z $portnum ] ; then exec /DNP3_linux-arm64/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host else exec /DNP3_linux-arm64/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host --port:$portnum fi AMD64 #!/bin/sh if [ -z $portnum ] ; then exec /DNP3_linux-x64/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host else exec /DNP3_linux-x64/OSIsoft.Data.System.Host --port:$portnum fi Name the script dnp3dockerstart.sh and save it to the directory where you plan to create the container. Create a Docker container containing the adapter Create the following Dockerfile in the directory where you want to create and run the container. Note: Dockerfile is the required name of the file. Use the variation according to your operating system. ARM32 FROM ubuntu WORKDIR / RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y ca-certificates libicu60 libssl1.1 curl COPY dnp3dockerstart.sh / RUN chmod +x /dnp3dockerstart.sh ADD ./DNP3_linux-arm.tar.gz .

ENTRYPOINT [\"/dnp3dockerstart.sh\"] Copy the DNP3_linux-\\<platform>.tar.gz file to the same directory as the Dockerfile . Copy the dnp3dockerstart.sh script to the same directory as the Dockerfile . Run the following command line in the same directory (you may need to use the sudo command): docker build -t dnp3adapter . Run the adapter Docker container REST access from the local host to the Docker container Complete the following steps to run the container: Use the docker container image dnp3adapter that you created previously. Type the following command line (you may need to use the sudo command): docker run -d --network host dnp3adapter The default port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to DNP3 adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, all data stored by the adapter is stored in the container itself. When the container is deleted, the data stored is also deleted. Provide persistent storage for the Docker container Complete the following to run the container: Use the docker container image dnp3adapter created previously. Type the following command line (you may need to use the sudo command): docker run -d --network host -v /dnp3:/usr/share/OSIsoft/ dnp3adapter The default port 5590 is accessible from the host and you can make REST calls to the DNP3 adapter from applications on the local host computer. In this example, data is written to a host directory on the local machine /dnp3 rather than the container. You can specify any directory. Port number change To use a different port other than the default 5590 , you can specify a portnum variable on the docker run command line. For example, to start the DNP3 adapter using port 6000 instead of 5590 , use the following command line: docker run -d -e portnum=6000 --network host dnp3adapter This command accesses the REST API with port 6000 instead of port 5590 . The following curl command returns the configuration for the container. curl http://localhost:6000/api/v1/configuration Remove REST access to the Docker container If you remove the --network host option from the docker run command, REST access is not possible from outside the container. This can be valuable when you want to host an application in the same container as the DNP3 adapter but do not want to have external REST access enabled."

Egress is handled individually per configured endpoint. When data is egressed for the first time, types and containers are egressed to the configured endpoint. After that only new or changed types or containers are egressed. Type creation must be successful in order to create containers. Container creation must be successful in order to egress data. If you delete an egress endpoint, data flow immediately stops for that endpoint. Buffered data in a deleted endpoint is permanently lost. Type, container, and data items are batched into one or more OMF messages when egressing. As per the requirements defined in OMF, a single message payload will not exceed 192KB in size. Compression is automatically applied to outbound egress messages. On the egress destination, failure to add a single item results in the message failing. Types, containers, and data are egressed as long as the destination continues to respond to HTTP requests."

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the EdgeCmd utility for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form where cryptographic key material is stored separately in a secure location. If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system individually using REST, but you can also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call.

    "title": "PI Adapter for DNP3 principles of operation",
    "keywords": "PI Adapter for DNP3 principles of operation The DNP3 adapter's operations focus on data collection and stream creation. Connectivity and interoperability The DNP3 adapter can connect to one or more DNP3 compliant outstations through TCP/IP connections. The total number of outstations that the adapter can connect to varies across different installation environments. The DNP3 adapter is designed to operate with Level 1 (DNP3–L1) compliance, which defines minimum requirements for all DNP3 compliant devices. However, the adapter makes use of some Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4 functions. Some DNP3 compliant devices can not support these same features. Any functionality described in this documentation that is not required for Level 1 compliance is be noted as such. Refer to the outstation documentation prior to using these features, as the adapter needs to be configured to only use the supported features of the outstation. Adapter configuration For the DNP3 adapter to start data collection, you need to configure the adapter by defining the following: Data source: Provide the information required to connect to your DNP3 compliant outstations. Data selection: Select the DNP points on the outstations you want the adapter to collect for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more information, see PI Adapter for DNP3 data source configuration , PI Adapter for DNP3 data selection configuration , and Logging configuration . Stream creation The DNP3 adapter creates types at startup. One stream is created for each selected DNP point represented by an item in the data selection configuration. Each stream contains two properties: Property name Data type Description Timestamp DateTime Timestamp of the value update for the DNP point Value Specified in the data selection configuration Value of the DNP point Certain metadata are sent with each stream created. The following metadata are common for every adapter type: ComponentId : Specifies the data source, for example, DNP3_1 ComponentType : Specifies the type of adapter, for example, DNP3 Each stream created for a given DNP point has a unique identifier (stream ID). If you specify a custom stream ID for the DNP point in data selection configuration, the adapter uses that stream ID to create the stream. If the stream ID is not specified, the adapter uses the DefaultStreamIdPattern in the data source configuration to determine the stream ID. Discovery The DNP3 adapter can discover points on your DNP3 outstation by performing an integrity scan. For more information, see Integrity scans . Discovery populates your data selection configuration with items that represent points on the outstation. These items are unselected by default, so you can make changes to these items before you select them. The adapter can only discover points that are assigned to Class 0, Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 on the outstation. Discovery can be demanding in terms of bandwidth and outstation resources, so the adapter only performs discovery for an outstation when the following criteria are met: The outstation is configured in the data source configuration. The adapter is configured to perform an integrity scan for that outstation. The data selection configuration contains no items that correlate to that outstation, either selected or unselected. To discover a new outstation, add the outstation to the data source configuration and configure a periodic integrity scan or a scan on startup. The adapter uses the first integrity scan as a means for discovery. To configure a new outstation without triggering a discovery, you can add one or more selection items to correspond to the outstation. The items can be selected or unselected. Alternatively, you can configure the outstation behavior so that no integrity scan is performed. Without an integrity scan, discovery is not be possible. Data collection The DNP3 adapter can collect two different types of data from DNP3 compliant outstations: static data and event data. Static data The DNP3 specification defines static data as the current value of a DNP point at the time of a request. The DNP3 adapter can be configured to request static data by polling the outstation for a range of points that share an object group and variation, which are configured in the data selection configuration. Static data is reported with the current time of the adapter machine. When polling for static data at predefined rate, it is possible that quickly changing data can be missed by the adapter. It is also possible that the adapter receives multiple values representing the same event but with different timestamps. The adapter makes a request for the current value of specific points as configured in the data selection configuration file. The adapter requests this data through a range scan, which request the static data for a range of point indices that share a group and variation, as configured in the data selection configuration. The outstation should report the current value of each point, but the outstation is not required to report using the requested object variation. If the outstation responds with a different variation than what the adapter has requested, the adapter still sends the data it receives. This could lead to differences in the reported value versus what is expected in terms of precision and status. Support for requesting static data for DNP3 points through a range scan is at least a Level 2 functionality, and some groups and variations can be considered Level 3 or Level 4 functionality. Because of this, it is important to verify that your outstation supports this functionality before configuring the adapter to collect data in this manner. Some DNP3-L1 compliant outstations can optionally support this type of scan. Event data The DNP3 specification defines event data as the information that is retained regarding an event. An event is defined by the DNP3 specification as the occurrence of something significant happening. What constitutes an event can vary depending on the implementation of the outstation. Typically, an event results in a value change for a DNP point, although it is possible for an event to occur that does not change the value of any point on the outstation. Event data is saved at the outstations and should be kept until the adapter confirms that it has received the event object. The event object is the description of the event that the adapter should receive from the outstations. The event object can contain the value, time, and status code relating to the event and corresponding point. The exact information contained in the object is dependent on both the point type and variation defined in the DNP3 specification. DNP3 events belong to one of three different classes of data: Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3. These event classes can be used to group events by priority, though neither the DNP3 adapter nor the DNP3 specification assign significance to the three event classes. According to the DNP3 specification, all DNP3 – Level 1 compliant outstations accepts read requests for event class data. Event scans The DNP3 adapter can be configured to request event data through an event scan. During an event scan, the adapter polls the outstation(s) for the event data from each of the configured event classes. The event classes and the polling interval can be configured in the data source configuration. For more information, see PI Adapter for DNP3 data source configuration . Event scans offer several advantages over polling for static data. When polling for static data, it is possible to miss value changes for points on the outstation; however, event scans ensures that each outstation reports every event to the adapter. Similarly, even when polling quickly, some events could be missed if they do not change the value of the DNP point. If bandwidth is a concern, the adapter can make efficient use of the network by only requesting event data. When polling for static data, the outstation can report unchanging data unnecessarily, whereas event scans should only return new events. It is important that the adapter is configured to perform event scans at an interval that is not long enough to allow the outstation event buffers to become full. To determine what constitutes an event and how much time it takes before the buffer becomes full, refer to the documentation for a specific outstation. Unsolicited events In addition to the event scans above, the DNP3 adapter can be configured to receive unsolicited responses containing event data. An unsolicited response is a message sent from an outstation that the adapter did not explicitly request. If the adapter is configured to receive unsolicited data, outstations that support sending unsolicited data should report event data to the adapter as it occurs. This could eliminate the need for the adapter to poll the outstation(s) for data. The decision to configure the adapter to receive unsolicited data or to perform event scans should be carefully considered. Integrity scans The DNP3 adapter can be configured to perform an integrity scan on startup, when the outstation's event buffer overflows, at a defined interval, or any combination of the three. During an integrity scan, the adapter polls the outstations for events and then the current value of all points that are assigned to one of the event classes (or Class 0). The adapter performs an integrity scan by polling Object Group 60 . If bandwidth or outstation performance is a concern, carefully consider the value of an integrity scan, as the outstation can respond with data for many more points than the adapter is configured to collect data for. The adapter simply discards any data that it receives without a corresponding data selection item. To retrieve the current value of any points not assigned to an event class, the adapter needs to perform a static scan."

Note: Some variations can include a flag octet to indicate status. While the PI Adapter for DNP3 can parse this data, storing this data is not currently supported. In addition, variation zero has a special meaning in DNP3. The adapter can be configured to request a variation zero for static scans, and the outstation should return data in a variation that it prefers. The outstation is not allowed to specify variation zero in its response. The adapter will not request a specific variation for event data, but it is able to parse any of the variations listed above."
